# Phase 5 End of phase project

## Aims

- I wanted to create an application that encourages travel around Japan.
- I have created three types of users to help encourage cultural exchange, these are the traveler, the citizen and the local business
- The intention of this app is to encourage people to learn more about Japan, and find the process of travelling around it easier.

## How to use Nihon-Go
- If you wish to play around with the application, you must first install pipenv shell.
- You must also run it from your server by running "pipenv shell" in the terminal in your root directory and then transfer into the server.

- For the front end, in your root directory, you should run:
- npm start --prefix nihongo_client 
- this will get the client side running.

## Thank You's 
- I would like to thank "bapex" for supplying the interactive map of Japan, that users can use to find research their desired prefectures.
